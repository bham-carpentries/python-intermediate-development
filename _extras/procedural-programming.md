In procedural programming code is grouped into
procedures (also known as routines -  reusable piece of code that performs a specific action but 
have no return value) and functions (similar to procedures but return value after an execution). 
Procedures and function both perform a single task, with exactly one entry and one exit point and 
containing a series of logical steps (instructions) to be carried out.
The primary concern is the *process* through which the input is transformed into the desired output.
Procedural languages treat data and procedures as two different 
entities (unlike in functional programming, where code is also treated as data). 

Key features of procedural programming include:

* Sequence control: the code execution process goes through the steps in a defined order, with clear starting and ending points.
* Modularity: code can be divided into separate modules or procedures to perform specific tasks, making it easier to maintain and reuse.
* Standard data structures: Procedural Programming makes use of standard data structures such as 
arrays, lists, and records to store and manipulate data efficiently.
* Abstraction: procedures encapsulate complex operations and allow them to be represented as simple, high-level commands.
* Execution control: variable implementations of loops, branches, and jumps give more control over the flow of execution.

To better understand procedural programming, it is useful to compare it with other prevalent 
programming paradigms such as 
[object-oriented programming](/object-oriented-programming/index.html) (OOP) 
and [functional programming](/functional-programming/index.html#functional-vs-procedural-programming)
to shed light on their distinctions, advantages, and drawbacks.
