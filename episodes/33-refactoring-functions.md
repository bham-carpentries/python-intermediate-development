teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How do you refactor code without breaking it?"
- "How do you write code that is easy to test?"
objectives:
- "Understand how to refactor functions to be easier to test"
- "Be able to write regressions tests to avoid breaking existing code"
- "Understand what a pure function is."
keypoints:
- "By refactoring code into pure functions that act on data makes code easier to test."
- "Making tests before you refactor gives you confidence that your refactoring hasn't broken anything"

## Introduction

* What is going to happen in this episode - learn good code design by refactoring some poorly
  structured code.

## Writing tests before refactoring

* Explain the benefits of writing tests before refactoring
* Explain techniques for writing tests for hard to test, existing code

> ## Exercise: Write regression tests before refactoring
> Write a regression test to verify we don't break the code when refactoring
>> ## Solution
>> * See this commit: https://github.com/thomaskileyukaea/python-intermediate-inflammation/commit/5000b6122e576d91c2acbc437184e00893483fdd
> {: .solution}

## Pure functions

* Explain what a pure function is

> ## Exercise: Refactor the function into a pure function
> Refactor the function to call a pure function that just operates on and returns data.
>> ## Solution
>> * See this commit: https://github.com/thomaskileyukaea/python-intermediate-inflammation/commit/4899b35aed854bdd67ef61cba6e50b3eeada0334
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

* Explain the benefits of pure functions for testing

> ## Exercise: Write some tests for the pure function
> Now we have refactored our a pure function, we can more easily write comprehensive tests
>> ## Solution
>> * See this commit: https://github.com/thomaskileyukaea/python-intermediate-inflammation/commit/4899b35aed854bdd67ef61cba6e50b3eeada0334

## Functional Programming

* Introduce that pure functions are a concept from functional programming
* Mention tools and techniques Python has for functional programming
