teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How to tell what is and isn't an appropriate abstraction"
objectives:
- "Understand how to determine correct abstractions. "
- "How to design large changes to the codebase."
keypoints:
- "YAGNI - you ain't gonna need it - don't create abstractions that aren't useful."
- "The best code is simple to understand and test, not the most clever or uses advanced language features."

## Introduction

* Talk about the bigger picture of design having seen some techniques

## Architecting larger changes

* Talk about box diagrams

> ## Exercise: Design a high-level architecture
> Consider implementing a new feature
> TODO: suggest a more complex feature
> Using boxes and lines sketch out an architecture for the code.
> Discuss with your team
>> ## Solution
>> An example design for the hypothetical problem.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

## An abstraction too far

* Drawbacks of abstraction
* Example showing too complex abstractions

## You Ain't Gonna Need It

* Introduce and explain YAGNI principle

> ## Exercise: Applying to real world examples
> Thinking about the examples of good and bad code you identified at the start of the episode.
> Identify what kind of principles were and weren't being followed
> Identify some refactorings that could be performed that would improve the code
> Discuss the ideas as a group.

## Conclusion

* Take care to think about software with the appropriate priorities and things will get better.
* Tips for getting better at architecture
