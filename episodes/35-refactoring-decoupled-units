teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What is de-coupled code?"
- "When is it useful to use classes to structure code?"
objectives:
- "Understand the object-oriented principle of polymorphism and interfaces."
- "Be able to introduce appropriate abstractions to simplify code."
- "Understand what decoupled code is, and why you would want it."
keypoints:
- "By using interfaces, code can become more decoupled."
- "Decoupled code is easier to test, and easier to maintain."

## Introduction

* What is coupled and decoupled code
* Why decoupled code is better

## Polymorphism

* Introduce what a class is
* Introduce what an interface is
* Introduce what polymorphism is
* Explain how we can use polymorphism to introduce abstractions

## How polymorphism is useful

* Introduce the idea of using a different implementation
  without changing the code
* Explain how to test code that uses an interface

## Object Oriented Programming

* Polymorphism is a tool from object oriented programming
* Outline some other tools from OOP that might be useful
