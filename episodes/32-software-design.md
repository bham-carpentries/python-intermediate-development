teaching: 15
exercises: 30
questions:
- "What should we consider when designing software?"
- "What goals should we have when structuring our code"
objectives:
- "Understand what an abstraction is, and when you should use one"
- "Understand what refactoring is"
keypoints:
- "How code is structured is important for helping future people understand and update it"
- "By breaking down our software into components with a single responsibility, we avoid having to rewrite it all when requirements change.
Such components can be as small as a single function, or be a software package in their own right."
- "When writing software used for research, requirements will almost *always* change."
- "*'Good code is written so that is readable, understandable, covered by automated tests, not over complicated and does well what is intended to do.'*"
